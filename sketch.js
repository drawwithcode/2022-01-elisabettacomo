//Setting the variables:
//radius defines the distance between the center of the circles and the center of the rotation
let radius = 20;

//the starting value of the angle is 0
let angle = 0;

//as we want to increase the stroke of the circles, we must define the variable of the stroke
let border = 2.2;

//this is the diameter of the smallest circle
let diameter = 70;
